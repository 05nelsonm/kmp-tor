    Required if Foreground
    Default: false

    If set to `true`, TorService will run in the foreground. Upon setting to
    `true`, the bellow attributes that are denoted as `Required` must be set.

    Must add to AndroidManifest.xml the following permission for API 28+:
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />

    Note that setting this to `true` means that if your application is swiped from
    the recent app's tray and then Tor is stopped (either by user action, or if
    `tor_service_stop_service_on_task_removed` is unset or `true`), Tor takes a
    moment to shutdown. As such, there is approximately 1 second where your
    application's State is still started (as if the app was not swiped from the
    recent app's tray).

    This is monitored by TorService and, if the Task is still removed after Tor
    finally shuts down, exitProcess(0) is called. If the User returns to your
    application before Tor finally stops (when exitProcess is called) and the
    last action prior to Task removal was _not_ STOP, TorService will attempt to
    start itself in order to return to the originally intended state of Tor ON.

    <!--
    Not Required
    Default: true

    If set to `false`, when the user swipes your application from the recent app's
    tray, the service will continue running.

    It is highly advisable to, if setting this option to `false`, also enable the
    stop notification action.
