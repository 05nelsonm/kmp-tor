        Declare a color (or reference to another color) in
        your base AppTheme. This will be utilized automatically
        as the notification color when the TorRuntime instance is
        ready (i.e. 100% Bootstrapped and Network is enabled).

        e.g.

        <style name="AppTheme" parent="@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight.NoActionBar">
            <item name="kmp_tor_ui_color_ready">?attr/colorPrimary</item>
        </style>
    -->
    <attr name="kmp_tor_ui_color_ready" format="reference|color" />
